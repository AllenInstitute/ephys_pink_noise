This code was originally written by Corinne Teeter with intellectual contributions from
Stefan Mihalas, Vilas Menon, Ramakrishnan Iyer, and Nicholas Cain.  This code creates the 
basic pink noise stimuli used in the noise1, noise2, and ramp to rheo stimulus used in the Allen 
Institute for Brain Science electrophysiology pipeline.
Note that the output trace created by this code may not exactly match
what was used in our stimulus due to the random seed.  Exact traces 
can be found in the experimental .nwb files.
